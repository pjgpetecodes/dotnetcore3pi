# Dot Net Core 3 Installation on a Raspberry Pi

You can install Dot Net Core 3 on the Raspberry Pi in one command by executing;

```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjgpetecodes/dotnetcore3pi/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

# Local Install Script

If you've cloned this repo, you can install Dot Net Core 3 by running the following in the root of the repo;

```
sudo chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh 

```

# IoT Hub Connection

The 3 IoT Hub Based Examples will require an IoT Hub Device Primary Connection String to work. 

# Deploying from VS Code on Windows

If you want to Deploy from VSCode on a Windows PC, then modify the RaspberryDeployWSL task's ```rsync``` command in the ```.vscode/tasks.json``` files in the various projects to point to your Pi IP Address;

```
"'sshpass -p \"raspberry\" rsync -rvuz $(wslpath '\"'${workspaceFolder}'\"')/bin/linux-arm/publish/ pi@[Enter Your IP Address]:share/${workspaceFolderBasename}/'"
```

Replace the ```[Enter Your IP Address]``` Section with the IP Address of your Pi (No Square Brackets!).

You will also need to change the username (```pi@```) and password (```-p \"raspberry"```) if you have altered those too.

# Debugging from VS Code on Windows

If you want to Debug from VSCode on a Windows PC, then modify the ```.NET Core Launch Console``` task in the ```.vscode/launch.json``` files in the various projects to point to your Pi's Hostname;

```
"pipeArgs": [
    "-pw",
    "raspberry",
    "root@[Your Pi Hostname].local"
],
```

You'll also need to install the VS Debugger;

```
curl -sSL https://aka.ms/getvsdbgsh | bash /dev/stdin -r linux-arm -v latest -l ~/vsdbg
```

You may also need to install curl and zip if they're not already installed;

```
sudo apt-get install curl
```

# Ensuring that projects use .NET Core and minor versions

Now that we have .NET 5 and 6, if you have that installed, new projects will default to that automatically.

To ensure that you create a .NET Core project (assuming you want to!), create a global.json file with the following contents in the directory you want to create your project;

```
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "3.1.409",
    "rollForward": "latestMinor"
  }
}
```

It's also best to install the latest
